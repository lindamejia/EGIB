        <h1>GETTING IT RIGHT THE FIRST TIME WITH ATTORNEYS YOU CAN TRUST
        </h1>
        <p>
          When dealing with a family law matter such as separation, divorce, child custody, support, domestic violence,
          or restraining orders you need Westchester family attorneys on your side with experience and a proven track
          record. While family law court orders are often modifiable, the courts tend to give deference to the past
          order. Therefore, getting it right the first time is important.

                child custody case. I had battled for years, with another lawyer representing me. Eastmond was
                recommended by a friend. Within weeks of taking over my case, they forced my ex-wife’s attorney to
                provide her business records which then led to a fair settlement agreement. I would recommend any one of
                the attorneys in this firm. They look out for your best interests and have your back the entire time.
                Thank you again Eastmond for absolutely everything."

                "I was desperately in search of help to assist me with initiating divorce proceedings when I found
                Stephany Eastmond. The attorney I worked with, who is bilingual in English-Spanish, immediately filed an
                emergent application with the court seeking to prevent my husband from leaving the country for Europe
                with my two children. She diligently advocated on my behalf and we won which prevented him from taking
                my children away from me! Not only was the order obtained, but all my spousal privileges were protected
                despite my husband’s claim that he could do whatever he wanted. Stephany convinced the judge that I
                should have custody. Additionally she got me a spousal and child support award. My attorney guided me
                through the darkest moments of life. I am so thankful for my attorney’s dedication and professionalism.
                She was able to explain everything in my native language."

                most helpful firm in the area. Keith was my attorney and had less than 24 hours to prepare for an
                emergent restraining order hearing in my case. He has a commanding presence in the courtroom. He is
                experienced and super kind. Thanks to his decades of dealing with domestic violence and the help of the
                firm, despite my husband’s lies, we were successful at the hearing which would have immediately impacted
                my job and left me with no income. Not only were they swift with their actions, but they also worked
                with me financially. They refuted my husband’s claims and helped me protect myself, my reputation and my
