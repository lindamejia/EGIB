    <h5 >Domestic Violence FAQ</h5>
    <p>A person's home is supposed to be a safe place, defined by the love and support of family members. But sadly, the
      home can be a place of fear and violence for many -- and it too often goes unreported and unnoticed. Domestic
      violence is a serious offense that can leave emotional (as well as physical) scars that last a lifetime.</p>
    <p>
      The following are answers to the more frequently asked questions about domestic violence.

            <p>Domestic violence or family violence is a pattern of abusive behavior in a relationship that is used by
              one partner to exert control over another intimate partner. Domestic violence can take many forms,
              including:
            <ul>
              <li>Physical abuse</li>
              <li>Sexual abuse</li>

            You can go to court to request a protection or restraining order, which requires your abuser to stay a
            certain number of feet away from you, your home, your school, your work, and your car. This doesn’t stop an
            abuser from stalking or hurting you, but it does allow you to call the police to have the abuser arrested if
            he or she breaks the restraining or protection order and comes near you.
            You can obtain a restraining order by filing the required legal papers with your local court. You'll have to
            follow your state law on the "ex parte" hearing without the other party and serving the abuser with a copy
            of the restraining order. The police can sometimes serve the restraining order papers for you.

            National Domestic Violence Hotline at 1-800-799-SAFE, a local legal aid agency that can help with
            restraining orders, and your doctor or clergy.

            Not unless you're a mandated reporter, which is a person who is required to report child or certain adult
            abuse because of their profession. Doctors, nurses, teachers, and day care providers are often mandated
            reporters, but you should check the law in your state to learn whether you’re considered a mandatory
            reporter.
            Also, if the victim is under 18 years old, child abuse mandatory reporting laws apply. In some states,
            everyone must report child abuse, speak with us to determine your legal obligation.
            If you’re a victim of domestic violence, you don't have to report what happened to you. However, it’s
            probably in your best interests to do so. In addition, you may want to report abuse once you’re able to
            leave the relationship. On average, it takes a survivor seven attempts to permanently leave an abusive
            relationship, so don't be discouraged if you've tried leaving but returned.

            Yes. As a victim of domestic violence, you can sue your abuser for your injuries in civil court, even if
            you’ve gone through criminal proceedings and lost. Some states still prohibit suing a family member for
            assault, battery, or other torts; but make sure you check the laws of your state regarding lawsuits.
            All states have statutes of limitations (time limits) for filing claims, so you should seek a consultation
            as soon as possible.

            Absolutely. Anyone can be a victim of domestic violence, including men. Men, women, children, teens and
            people of every race, ethnicity, religion, sexual orientation, and socioeconomic background can be victims.
            Domestic violence laws typically protect men and women equally. Most state laws are designed to protect
            victims, no matter what gender, from their abusers (of any gender).

            An order of protection is issued by the court to limit the behavior of someone who harms or threatens to
            harm another person. It is used to address various types of safety issues, including, but not limited to
            situations involving domestic violence. Family Courts, criminal courts, and Supreme Courts can all issue
            orders of protection. For information and hotline numbers for addressing situations involving domestic
            violence, see below.
            An order of protection may direct the offending person not to injure, threaten or harass you, your family,
            or any other person(s) listed in the order. It may include, but is not limited to, directing him/her to:
            <ul>

            <p>A Family Court order of protection is issued as part of a civil proceeding. Its purpose is to stop
              violence within a family, or within an intimate relationship, and provide protection for those individuals
              affected. All Family Court proceedings are confidential.</p>
            <p>
              To obtain an order of protection in the Family Court, your relationship to the other person must fall into
              one of the following categories:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Current or former spouse</li>
              <li>Someone with whom you have a child in common</li>
              <li>A family member to whom you are related by blood or marriage</li>
              <li>Someone with whom you have or have had an “intimate relationship.” An intimate relationship does not
                have to be a sexual relationship. A relationship may be considered intimate depending on factors such as
                how often you see each other, or how long you have known each other. After a petition is filed, the
                court will decide if it is an intimate relationship.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              To start a proceeding in Family Court, you need to file a form called a Family Offense petition. The
              person filing the petition is called the “petitioner,” and the person the petition is filed against is
              called the “respondent.” You can contact the Family Court in your county for help completing and filing
              the petition. You may also wish to speak with an attorney or domestic violence advocate before filing.
              For information specific to filing an order of protection in New York visit the Family Court Website. This
              page also includes helpful information about what to expect in court no matter where in New York State you
              live.</p>
            <p>

              A criminal court order of protection is issued as a condition of a defendant’s release and/or bail in a
              criminal case. A criminal court order of protection may only be issued against a person who has been
              charged with a crime.</p>
            <p>
              Criminal cases are prosecuted for the State of New York by the district attorney. Although the district
              attorney may start a criminal case before a person is arrested, a criminal case usually begins with a
              person’s arrest. The person charged with abuse is called a “defendant.” The victim of abuse is called the
              “complaining witness.” There does not need to be a relationship between the complaining witness and the
              defendant.
              In a criminal case, the district attorney requests an order of protection for the victim or complaining
              witness. The judge decides whether to issue the order of protection and what terms and conditions will be
              included in the order.</p>
            <p>
              A Supreme Court order of protection can be issued as part of an ongoing divorce proceeding.
              If you have an ongoing divorce case and would like to request an order of protection, you may do so by
              making a written request by Motion or Order to Show Cause; or you may make an oral request at a court
              appearance. If you are represented by an attorney, your attorney may make the written or oral request for
              you. The judge decides whether to issue the order of protection and what terms and conditions will be
              included in the order.</p>

            It is a crime to violate a temporary or final order of protection. If the subject of the order of protection
            does not obey the order, then you can call the police. The police will probably arrest the individual for
            violating the order of protection. The individual does not have to hit you to violate the order. If the
            individual comes to your home and the order says he/she can't, then you can call the police. You also have
            the right to file a violation of the order in Family Court. Filing a violation in Family Court usually will
            not result in arrest of the individual who has violated the order. You can choose to go to Family or
            criminal Court, or both.

            Integrated Domestic Violence (IDV) Courts help families by bringing different case types—criminal, family
            and matrimonial (divorce)—together to be heard by one judge. This court uses the “one family - one judge”
            approach for cases that involve domestic violence within a family. The judge decides which cases are
            appropriate for the IDV Court.
            For more information regarding this court type, go to the IDV Court web site.
